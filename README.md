## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 
* * Investing (Robo-Advisor)
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
<<<<<<< HEAD
* * For many of us, investing can seem overly complicated and somewhat intimidating if you don’t know the ins and outs. Acorns intend to simplify and demystify this process through a revolutionary mobile app. The Acorns app was created to remove any mental roadblocks or anxiety about becoming a regular investor. Using Modern Portfolio Theory it recommends optimized portfolios and keeps them on track with automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment. Here's our Acorns review. And one of the majer way they use is **Round-Up** featuer and this is how this featuer works: The Round-Up transfers come from monitoring your linked account and rounding up the purchases to the nearest dollar. For example, I spent $22.43 at the gas station this week. That amount was rounded up to $23, and the extra 57 cents were added to my Acorns Round-Up balance. Once the Round-Up balance reaches $5, the money will be withdrawn from my bank account and added to my Acorns investment.
You can choose which transactions you want to include in your Round-Up amount or set it to “automatic,” in which case Acorns will apply the feature to all eligible purchases.
However, you can also turbo-charge the power of Round-Ups by as much as ten times.
So instead of pitching in just those 57 cents from my gas station purchase, I can elect to invest as much as $5.70 for that transaction automatically. The potential to magnify the savings is enormous. [7](https://investorjunkie.com/reviews/acorns/)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
* * **Automated approach:** We’re behind any tool that encourages mindless, automatic saving. If you don’t have to think about saving, you’re more likely to do it.
* * **Minimum investment:** There’s no minimum to open an account, but the service requires a $5 balance to start investing in one of Acorn’s five pre-built portfolios.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* * **Found Money:** The only thing better than building an investment portfolio out of a bunch of spare change is building an investment portfolio out of someone else’s money. Acorns' Found Money program essentially lets you do that: It’s cash back for your investment account.[9](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/advisors/acorns?scrollTo=full-review-scroll-target)
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
* * Acorns has found unprecedented growth as the coronavirus brings new users into its world of investing and saving money. The company recently hit a milestone of 7 million sign-ups, continuing the trend that trading apps are benefiting from a down market.
* * According to this study about Robo-advisor performance for the past 2.5 years Acorns was 3.49%, number 8 in the top 20 Robo-advisor company in the chart.[10](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/robo-advisor-performance-is-only-one-piece-of-the-puzzle/)

## Recommendations
* For the microsavings category, I think Acorns is the best service available. 
* Acorns is a good start if you have little to save or need a nudge to start investing without affecting your lifestyle. However, the monthly deposits are way too small to be considered a serious method for saving toward retirement.
* For exampile **Betterment** is a better option for large deposit amounts with lower annual fee. n response to Acorns' microsavings service, **Betterment** has **SmartDeposit**, automating investing once your bank account is above a specified dollar amount. However, nothing is stopping you from using both services to boost your savings rate.
