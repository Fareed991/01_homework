Using Modern Portfolio Theory it recommends optimized portfolios and keeps them on track with automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment. And one of the majer way they use is **Round-Up** featuer and this is how this featuer works: The Round-Up transfers come from monitoring your linked account and rounding up the purchases to the nearest dollar.

However, you can also turbo-charge the power of Round-Ups by as much as ten times.

## Recommendations
* For the microsavings category, I think Acorns is the best service available. 
* Acorns is a good start if you have little to save or need a nudge to start investing without affecting your lifestyle. However, the monthly deposits are way too small to be considered a serious method for saving toward retirement.
* For exampile **Betterment** is a better option for large deposit amounts with lower annual fee. n response to Acorns' microsavings service, **Betterment** has **SmartDeposit**, automating investing once your bank account is above a specified dollar amount. 
* Ultimately, most individuals don’t save enough for a rainy day, and Acorns will help start you down this path.
